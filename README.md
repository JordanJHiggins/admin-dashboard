# admin-dashboard

This admin-dashboard project was built with vanilla CSS, no frameworks or preprocessors. The aim of this project was to practice using CSS grid and flexbox together. The layout is designed with 3 main sections: 

- A header section  which includes a search bar, user greeting, utility buttons, user info and profile image. 
-  A navigation bar that houses links to other areas of the site.
-  And a main content section where projects, announcements and trending users are found.
